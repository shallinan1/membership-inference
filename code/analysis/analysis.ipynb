Maybe it’s the fact that we’ve already seen each other naked that makes talking about this easier. Maybe it’s that I went on this walk thinking I was about to get fired, and any other outcome has me feeling like I’ve just cheated death. Whatever it is, I run right toward it. “Hypothetically . . . you’d want to start slowly.” My voice takes on a huskiness that feels wholly out of place in a public setting, and when I get quieter, Finn leans in closer. “The more aroused she gets, the more likely she is to orgasm. It’s crucial to spend time building up that tension, figuring out what she likes. Ask her. She might prefer your hands, or your mouth. She might have a specific way she likes being touched. Or, even better—have her show you.” At that, his mouth slides open, accompanied by the smallest hitch in his breath. I almost don’t catch it, but that slight hint this conversation is as exciting for him as it is for me sends a shock straight to my core. “You’ve done that?” he says. “Shown someone?” “Yes,” I say, as calmly as I can. “Masturbation doesn’t always have to be a solo act. What about you?” He shakes his head, that pesky lock of hair falling back across his forehead. “I’m usually fairly easy.” “I got that.” This earns me a soft jab of his elbow against my shoulder. “You have to listen. Communication is probably the most important part of it, more important than the physical.” Although I wouldn’t hate his physical elbow touching my physical shoulder again. “You can’t expect that what works for one person will work for everyone.” “I’m not asking about everyone.” His gaze clings to mine. “I’m asking about you.” Jesus. I have to break eye contact or else I’ll incinerate. “I like when someone’s clearly paying attention to my body,” I say, dragging my fingertips out along the railing, and then back. His eyes follow them. “My breaths. My slightest movements. The places where I might be tighter, and the places where I open up.” A nod. Another step closer, a few inches separating his chest from mine. “And I love when it’s obvious that he’s enjoying what he’s doing to',\n",

Maybe even in the whole state of Oregon. “I want to learn.” He pushes a wayward strand of hair back into place, but it’s no match for the wind. “I was up half the night googling, but it all started to blur together after a while. And I’m only a little scared of the targeted ads I’m going to get now.” I let out a deep, shaky breath, my heart turning wild in my chest. Because maybe the scariest thing about this conversation is that I want to tell him. The thrill racing up my spine is a foreign, delicious thing, impossible to ignore. Maybe it’s the fact that we’ve already seen each other naked that makes talking about this easier. Maybe it’s that I went on this walk thinking I was about to get fired, and any other outcome has me feeling like I’ve just cheated death. Whatever it is, I run right toward it. “Hypothetically . . . you’d want to start slowly.” My voice takes on a huskiness that feels wholly out of place in a public setting, and when I get quieter, Finn leans in closer. “The more aroused she gets, the more likely she is to orgasm. It’s crucial to spend time building up that tension, figuring out what she likes. Ask her. She might prefer your hands, or your mouth. She might have a specific way she likes being touched. Or, even better—have her show you.” At that, his mouth slides open, accompanied by the smallest hitch in his breath. I almost don’t catch it, but that slight hint this conversation is as exciting for him as it is for me sends a shock straight to my core. “You’ve done that?” he says. “Shown someone?” “Yes,” I say, as calmly as I can. “Masturbation doesn’t always have to be a solo act. What about you?” He shakes his head, that pesky lock of hair falling back across his forehead. “I’m usually fairly easy.” “I got that.” This earns me a soft jab of his elbow against my shoulder. “You have to listen. Communication is probably the most important part of it, more important than the physical.” Although I wouldn’t hate his physical elbow touching my physical shoulder again. “You can’t expect that what works for one person will work for everyone.” “I’m not asking about everyone.” His gaze clings to mine. “I’m asking about you.” Jesus. I have to break eye contact or else I’ll incinerate. “I like when someone’s clearly paying attention to my body,” I say, dragging my fingertips out along the railing, and then back. His eyes follow them. “My breaths. My slightest movements. The places where I might be tighter, and the places where I open up.” A nod.

Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat. Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge.
